</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure that you read these Terms of Use carefully.</p>
<p>
    These Terms of Use form the basis for your use of the Coronalert-App (“CAA”)
    and any future versions thereof (patches, updates and upgrades) (“App”) and
    the use of any other services which are already available or may be made
    available by the SCIENSANO in connection with the App.
</p>
<p>
    The separate Data Protection Declaration forms an integral part of these Terms
    of Use. Please also read the Data Protection Declaration carefully.
</p>
<p>
    The App is available from the Apple App Store for all iOS devices and from
    Google Play for all Android devices.
</p>
<p>
    The general terms and conditions for apps available from Apple or Google do
    not apply with respect to SCIENSANO. SCIENSANO is solely responsible for the
    content and maintenance of the App and for any legal claims you may have in
    respect of the App.
</p>
<p>
    You confirm that you agree to these Terms of Use when you install and use the
    App.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not install or use the App
    (or you will need to uninstall it) and you will not be able to use any of the
    related services or systems. This will not affect any rights under any open
    source licenses relating to the App’s source code.
</p>
<p>
    You are still responsible for complying with these Terms of Use if you give
    the device on which the App is installed to a third party and they use the
    App.
</p>
<p>
    The App is intended for use by anyone who is 18 or over. Anyone under 18 may
    only use the App with the permission of their parent or its legal
    representative
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. What features does the app have?</h2>
<p>
    The aim of the Coronalert App is to disrupt chains of infection of SARS-CoV-2
    at an early stage. The intention is to notify people quickly about any contact
    they may have had with infected individuals and any potential exposure to the
    virus. This will allow people to self-isolate and limit the spread of the
    SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
</p>
<p>
    The key features of the App are set out below. The details provided are solely
    for your information. They do not constitute legally binding specifications or
    any agreement that certain features must be available.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Background app</h3>
<p>
    The App runs in the background on your device and automatically stores and
    encrypts random IDs (rolling proximity identifiers) produced by other nearby
    devices. The App regularly collects a list of random IDs (temporary exposure
    keys) via the Sciensano Services for those individuals who have voluntarily
    registered themselves as being infected. It then compares these against the
    random IDs already stored on the device and identifies any situation where an
    infection could have been passed on.
</p>
<p>
    The App is only able to identify and register encounters with other persons if
    the App is equally installed on a device carried on by such person and if such
    person meets all the conditions for using the App. The App is not able to
    register whether the user has had contact with other people as such.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Exposure notification</h3>
<p>
    You will receive a notification if you have had exposure to someone who has a
    confirmed infection. This notification will include instructions on what you
    should do next. This may include contacting a medical professional or the
    local public health department and/or self-isolating at home.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Notification of test results</h3>
<p>
    As soon as you have been tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection, you can use the
    App to start the digital test notification process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Positive result</h3>
<p>
    If your SARS-CoV-2 test is positive, you may use the App to voluntarily
    publish your own random IDs registered by the App for the last 14 days as
    diagnosis keys. This will enable other App users to check on their own devices
    whether they may have had exposure to you during that period.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. What do i do if i have been exposed to a confirmed case?</h2>
<p>
    If the App notifies you that you have been exposed to a confirmed case, you
    will also receive information on what to do next. These instructions are not
    legally binding, but SCIENSANO does recommend that you follow them. The
    recommendations referred to above do not affect any applicable legal or
    contractual obligations or any official requirements on what to do in the
    event of any exposure to a confirmed case. You must still comply with any such
    obligations or requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The App does not and cannot be used to provide any form of medical diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
    The notification does not mean that you have SARS-CoV-2. It simply means that
    you have been exposed to someone with a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 during
    the last 14 days and that you may also potentially have been infected.
</p>
<p>
    You may receive an exposure notification which is not accurate. Your device
    may, for example, register an exposure at a time when you are not close to
    your device or while someone else is using it. Exposures may also be wrongly
    registered due to existing limitations in contact/proximity measurement.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. The app does not protect you against infection</h2>
<p>The App serves to disrupt chains of infection.</p>
<p>The App will not protect you against infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>The App does not reduce your own personal risk of infection.</p>
<p>
    You can still catch SARS-CoV-2 without the App notifying you of the exposure
    to the person who may have infected you: the App does not register all your
    contact with other people. This may be because other people are not using the
    App, you do not always have your device on you or you do not have the App
    activated at all times. There are also certain limitations in terms of
    contact/proximity measurement.
</p>
<p>
    The App only notifies you of potential exposures to confirmed cases. The App
    needs to have registered your contact with a confirmed case and the infected
    individual needs to have activated the App’s warning feature. Activating the
    warning feature is voluntary and not all infected individuals may do so.
</p>
<p>
    Please use the App in conjunction with the other relevant precautions and
    official requirements.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Warning feature</h2>
<p>
    You can use the App to warn other people you have had contact with that you
    have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. You may only activate the warning feature
    if your positive test result came from an approved testing lab.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use of the warning feature without good reason</h3>
<p>
    You may not activate the warning feature without good reason and doing so may
    have serious consequences. You may, for example, be liable for damages towards
    any other affected individuals.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of any use of the App which is not in line with these Terms of
    Use, SCIENSANO reserves the right to ban users from accessing the App.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Technical requirements</h2>
<p>
    The following technical requirements need to be met in order to use the App
</p>
<h3>You will need a data connection</h3>
<p>
    Certain features of the App are based on central services and systems provided
    via the SCIENSANO Services. These features are therefore only available if
    your device has an internet data connection enabling access to the SCIENSANO
    Services. Some or all of the features of the App will not be available if you
    do not have a data connection. The same will apply when your device is turned
    off or in flight mode.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The App must be running and activated</h3>
<p>
    The App muss must be running on your device (in the foreground or background)
    and must be activated. You will need to launch the App for this. If you fail
    to launch the App, or deactivate or quit the App, it will not register any
    encounters with other people and will not generate any random IDs which can be
    stored by other devices. You will need to relaunch the App if you restart your
    device (e.g. after turning it off, when the battery runs out or following an
    operating system update).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Settings on your device</h3>
<p>
    You will also need to activate the Bluetooth (BLE) functions on your device
    and allow the App to access them.
</p>
<p>
    Please check the settings on your device to see whether these functions are
    activated and may be accessed by the App.
</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that you are using the latest version of the App</p>
<p>
    SCIENSANO may publish occasional updates for the App. You will need to install
    these updates as soon as possible and ensure that you are always using the
    newest version of the App. Using older versions of the App may lead to
    technical issues or disruptions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>You will need to have the latest versions of iOS or Android</h3>
<p>
    The App uses functions implemented specifically by Apple on iOS and Google on
    Android.
</p>
<p>
    Please check the settings on your device to be sure to use the latest versions
    of iOS or Android to prevent technical issues or disruptions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Limitations of the app</h2>
<p>
    The App is designed to help you identify exposures you have had to people who
    subsequently received a positive test result. But you should always remember
    that the App has certain limitations.
</p>
<p>
    One of these is that, while the App is constantly sending out random IDs
    (rolling proximity identifiers), it only receives random IDs from other
    devices at specific intervals. The windows for receiving data in the App are
    very short. All these functionalities are based on the underlying Exposure
    Notification Framework from Apple and Google and can be changed by these
    companies at any time.
</p>
<p>
    The Bluetooth signal attenuation is used for the proximity measurement. A
    lower signal attenuation essentially means that the other device is closer. A
    higher signal attenuation means that either the other device is further away
    (i.e. a distance of more than two meters) or there is something between the
    two devices blocking the signal. This might include something like a wall or a
    bag containing the device, but could just as easily be people or animals.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. User rights</h2>
<p>
    You are hereby granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and
    revocable license, which may not be sub-licensed, to use the App for your own
    personal, non-commercial purposes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
