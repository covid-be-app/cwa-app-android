    <p>
        This Contact Tracing App was developed in the context of the Coronavirus
        outbreak and pursuant to an initiative&nbsp;from the Belgian Government.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App is based on a proximity tracing system called
        "Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing" ("DP-3T system")
        developed by an international consortium of technologists, legal experts,
        engineers and epidemiologists from various universities. More detailed
        information about the DP-3T system is publicly available at
        <a href="https://github.com/DP-3T/documents"
        >https://github.com/DP-3T/documents</a
        >. In addition, the Contact Tracing App uses the Exposure Notification System
        created by Google and Apple. This Exposure Notification System allows the
        Contact Tracing App to send notifications to the user as further explained
        below. More information on the Exposure Notification System is available at
        <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/"
        >https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/</a
        >.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of the Contact Tracing App is completely voluntary. In other words,
        there is no obligation whatsoever to install this Contact Tracing App.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App will be usable in any country that also uses a DP-3T
        system. If a Belgian user visits such a country, s/he&nbsp;can also receive
        notifications that s/he&nbsp;has been at risk in such a country.

    <h2>What is the purpose of the contact tracing app and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>Proximity tracing</p>
    <p>
        The purpose of the Contact Tracing App is to determine who has been in close
        physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the
        virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where and when exactly the
        contact occurred. This processing is based on grounds of public
        interest&nbsp;(art. 6.1 (e) GDPR) and, as far as data relating to health are
        concerned, grounds of public interest in the area of public health&nbsp;(9.2
        (i)&nbsp;GDPR). The processing is indeed carried out in the public interest as
        it aims at containing the spread of COVID-19 and to protect the population
        against this epidemic.
    </p>
    <p>
        To achieve this goal the Contact Tracing App generates Secret Keys and
        computes from these keys ephemeral (in other words, temporary), random ID
        which represent the user's phone. These IDs are ephemeral because they refresh
        at a high frequency (every 10-20 minutes), i.e. at the same frequency as the
        Bluetooth MAC address.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user’s phone broadcasts these random IDs and also records the random IDs
        observed from other phones that are nearby and store this together with the
        date, the signal strength and the duration.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be tested for COVID-19, a user has to contact a health care practitioner
        who will take a sample and will register an anonymous identifier from the
        user’s phone in the testing server. From then on, the Contact Tracing App will
        regularly check the testing server, by means of this anonymous identifier, to
        see whether the test result is available. Once the test result is available,
        the Contact Tracing App will inform the user about the test result: negative
        or positive. If the result is positive the user should contact the health
        practitioner and go in quarantine. The user can then decide to upload the
        Secret Keys to generate the random IDs previously broadcasted (as further
        described in paragraph&nbsp;4) to the central server. In order to minimize
        incorrect use, this upload will be authorized by the testing server that sends
        an authorization code to the central server. Subsequently all these Secret
        Keys are removed from the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Except if they are&nbsp;uploaded, the Secret Keys to generate the broadcasted
        random IDs remain on the phone for a period of maximum 14 days. The recorded
        random IDs never leave the phone&nbsp;and are destroyed after 14 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the Secret Keys to generate the broadcasted random IDs are uploaded by an
        infected user to the central server, the Contact Tracing App of other users
        can retrieve these Secret Keys from the server to estimate whether such other
        users were exposed to the virus through close-range proximity to a COVID-19
        positive person who has uploaded its data. If&nbsp;the Contact Tracing App
        retrieving the data from the server detects a substantial&nbsp;risk for
        infection&nbsp;(i.e. the user has been nearby to a COVID-19 positive person),
        it will inform the user of the Contact Tracing App and recommend certain
        actions by means of a push notification generated by the Contact Tracing App.
        It is the sole responsibility of the user to follow upon on these
        recommendations.
    </p>
    <p>For clarity and avoidance of doubt, the Contact Tracing App does NOT:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            monitor compliance with any government imposed quarantine, confinement or
            social distancing measures;
        </li>
        <li>track COVID-19 positive patients;</li>
        <li>send any information about users without a positive test result; and</li>
        <li>identify hotspots or trajectories of COVID-19 positive patients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Limited processing for statistical purposes</p>
    <p>
        On the basis of the information uploaded to the central server, Sciensano may
        compile limited aggregated statistics such as counting the number of keys
        uploaded per day and the number of people with an app who have tested positive
        each day.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What personal data are collected and processed when using the contact tracing
        app?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The DP-3T system is specifically designed to minimise data collection and
        processing. When using the Contact Tracing App, only data which allow to
        inform the user that s/he might have been exposed to the virus are collected.
        The Contact Tracing App does not reveal to the user who the potential
        contagious contact was, or where the contact happened. The only information
        provided is the date of the high risk contact.
    </p>
    <p>
        A detailed description of the collected data is given below. The collected
        data do not allow to identify individuals directly and or not intended to do
        so. However, it cannot be excluded that, for example, a user who is notified
        that s/he has been in close contact with an individual tested positive for
        COVID-19 may identify that individual. Therefore, the data is generally
        considered personal data, albeit pseudonymised. The data will be considered
        health-related data since (i) the app determines that a person is at risk of
        infection, (ii) the person records a test, and (iii) the person shares a
        positive test result.
    </p>
    <p>Secret Key</p>
    <p>
        Upon installation, the Contact Tracing App generates every day a Secret Key
        which is stored on the phone&nbsp;of the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Secret Keys are shared if the user notifies that s/he has been diagnosed
        with COVID-19 by uploading it to the central server as described in paragraph
        3.
    </p>
    <p>
        To protect the privacy of the users and to reduce the risk of singling out the
        persons that are uploading Secret Keys after having been diagnosed with
        COVID-19, the Contact Tracing App of every user uploads a dummy Secret Key (on
        average every 5 days) to the central server.
    </p>
    <p>Ephemeral random Identifiers (IDs)</p>
    <p>
        Phones with the Contact Tracing App installed broadcast random Identifiers,
        being combinations of ones and zeros, via Bluetooth. These IDs are computed
        from the Secret Keys. Once broadcasted, these IDs are deleted from the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        The phone receives the IDs that are broadcasted by nearby phones and locally
        stores the received IDs with the following information: received ID, signal
        strength, duration and date.
    </p>
    <p>
        These records of the received IDs are stored on the phone&nbsp;and never sent
        anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>IP Address</p>
    <p>The system does not store any IP addresses of users.</p>
    <p>Traffic data about the upload</p>
    <p>
        Users who upload their Secret Keys to the central server will do so together
        with the date on which the Secret Key was used&nbsp;and&nbsp;the estimated
        date on which the user became contagious.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App does not collect location data. However, the user may
        indicate him/herself within the Contact Tracing App in which country/ies s/he
        has been at a certain date for reasons of interoperability with other
        countries' contact tracing apps.&nbsp;In this case, the Secret Key will be
        sent to the country indicated by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only users for which the testing server has sent an authorisation code to the
        central server&nbsp;will be able to successfully upload data to the central
        server.
    </p>
    <p>Authorisation code</p>
    <p>
        When a user is tested COVID-19 positive, the testing server will send&nbsp;an
        authorisation code to the central server. When a user wants to upload its
        Secret Keys, the central server checks whether it has received an
        authorization code for this specific user. If the central has indeed received
        an authorization code for this specific user, the user will be able to upload
        the Secret Keys.
    </p>
    <p>Visited countries</p>
    <p>
        The user may choose to indicate within the Contact Tracing App which countries
        s/he has visited. Besides this, the Contact Tracing App does not collect or
        process any other location data.
    </p>
    <p>Personal data of children</p>
    <p>
        Taking into account the fact that the Contact Tracing App is aimed at
        protecting health and that its use can be considered as an act of a personal
        nature, and given the guarantees provided to greatly reduce the risks for
        users of the app (voluntary use, limited and pseudonymised data, reduced data
        storage time), it has been considered that from the age of 14 a child can
        consent alone to the downloading of the application. Below this age, the
        consent of the legal representative is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        This consent must be particularly enlightened and therefore requires the
        communication of specific information, adapted to the age of the minor
        (language, length of the document, typeface used, etc.). This information
        should be communicated at two moments: before downloading the app and after
        receiving a positive test result to consent to the upload of the Secret Keys
        to the central server.
    </p>

    <h2>Does the contact tracing app take automated decisions?</h2>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App does not take any automated decisions with regard to a
        user within the meaning of article 22 of the General Data Protection
        Regulation.
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>
    <h2>With whom are personal data shared?</h2>
    <p>Upload to the central server</p>
    <p>
        As described in paragraphs 3 and 4 the user may upload data to the central
        server. This central server is hosted under the responsibility of Sciensano.
    </p>
    <p>
        The central server only stores information of infected users if they decide to
        upload the Secret Keys&nbsp;to this server.
    </p>
    <p>Distribution to all apps</p>
    <p>
        As described in paragraphs 3 and 4 the keys uploaded to the central server are
        distributed on a daily basis to all apps. For efficiency reasons, this
        distribution can take place through a Content Distribution Network.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharing of personal data with national&nbsp;providers of European databases
        related to&nbsp;similar contact tracing apps in other countries
    </p>
    <p>
        If the user indicates in the Contact Tracing App that s/he has visited another
        EU country, the Secret Keys may be sent to the central servers of similar
        contact tracing apps in those EU countries directly or via the EU gateway.
    </p>
    <p>Sharing of personal data with ICT-providers</p>
    <p>
        By installing the Contact Tracing App,&nbsp;Google and Apple are able to see
        who installed the Contact Tracing App. However, they ensure that the system
        does not share the identity of users with them.
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>

    <h2>
        Are personal data transferred to countries outside of the European Union?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Personal data are not transferred to countries outside of the European
        Union.&nbsp;
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>

    <h2>How long are the personal data kept?</h2>
    <p>
        The personal data stored on each user's phone&nbsp;and on the central server
        are automatically removed after 14 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App will in any case be deactivated at the date determined
        by the applicable Belgian law.
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>

    <h2>How are the personal data protected?</h2>
    <p>
        The developers of the DP-3T system have attached great importance to the
        protection of personal data. The DP-3T system provides for the following
        privacy and security protections:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The system is designed to comply with state-of-the art cryptographic
            techniques and measures.
        </li>
        <li>
            All transmission of personal data are protected by
            authenticated&nbsp;encryption.
        </li>
        <li>
            Personal data is mainly stored on the user's phone&nbsp;and only limited
            information is sent to the central server if the user decides to send it
            (decentralized approach).
        </li>
        <li>
            The decentralized approach mitigates the risk of misuse of the personal data
            by a central authority.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition, the central server is protected by appropriate technical and
        organisational measures including strict access management.
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>

    <h2>What rights do users have?</h2>
    <p>
        Under the conditions provided for in the General Data Protection Regulation,
        users have the right to access their personal data, request rectification,
        erasure or restriction of the processing &nbsp;or object to the processing of
        their personal data (“data subject rights”).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sciensano will only be able to respond to requests from users where it will be
        able to link the data processed in the context of the Contact Tracing App to
        the specific user. To be able to link the data to the user, Sciensano would
        need to obtain additional data. As the Contact Tracing App is built on
        technology aiming at protecting the privacy of the users as much as possible,
        it is not desirable that Sciensano processes additional data merely to
        identify the user. Pursuant to article 11 GDPR, Scienscano cannot be obliged
        to process such additional data to identify the user for the sole purpose of
        complying with the data subject rights under the GDPR. This means that in
        practice, users will not be able to exercise their data subject rights unless
        additional information is provided to Sciensano.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users have the right to lodge a complaint with the Belgian Supervisory
        Authority (<a href="http://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be"
    >https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be</a
    >&nbsp;<a href="http://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be"

    <h2>Amendments to this privacy statement</h2>
    <p>
        Sciensano may amend this privacy statement from time to time in which case,
        Sciensano will inform the user of such change by means of a notification in
        the Contact Tracing App.
