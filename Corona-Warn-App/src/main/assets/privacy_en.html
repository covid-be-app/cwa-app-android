<p>PRIVACY NOTICE</p>
<p>This privacy notice explains what data is collected when you use the Corona-Alert-App, how that
    data is used, and your rights under data protection law.</p>
<p>To ensure that this privacy notice can be understood by all users, we have made every effort to
    make it simple and as non-technical as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WHO HAS PROVIDED YOU WITH THIS APP?</h2>
<p>The Corona-Alert-App (the “App”) is provided by SCIENSANO, a Public Institution created by the
    Belgian law of 25 February 2018 with registered office Rue Juliette Wytsman, 14, 1050 Brussels
    (BELGIUM) and registered with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises in Brussels under the number
    0693.876.830 (SCIENSANO).</p>
<p>SCIENSANO is also what is called the controller under data protection law, meaning it is
    responsible for the processing of App users’ data.</p>
<p>You can contact the SCIENSANO data protection officer at the above address (“FAO the data
    protection officer”) and by emailing: <a href="mailto:dpo@sciensano.be">dpo@sciensano.be</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>IS USING THE APP VOLUNTARY?</h2>
<p>Using the App is entirely voluntary. It is your decision alone whether and how you use the
    App.</p>
<p>Although installing and using the App is voluntary, if you wish to use the exposure logging
    feature you still have to grant SCIENSANO your consent to let the App process your personal
    data.</p>
<p>If the App identifies a potential risk of infection for you, then your data also includes health
    data.</p>
<p>Your consent is necessary because otherwise the App will not be able to access your smartphone’s
    exposure logging feature. You can, however, use the toggle switch in the App to disable the
    exposure logging feature at any time. Doing this will mean that you are unable to use the full
    functionality of the App.</p>
<p>The data processing performed in connection with these features is described in more detail in
    the following sections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>ON WHAT LEGAL BASIS IS YOUR DATA PROCESSED?</h2>
<p>In principle, SCIENSANO will process your personal data only on the basis of your consent granted
    pursuant to Article 6(1) Sentence 1(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the General Data Protection
    Regulation (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">GDPR</a>). If you have
    granted your consent, you can withdraw it at any time. Further information on your right of
    withdrawal and instructions on how to exercise this right can be found below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WHO IS THE APP AIMED AT?</h2>
<p>The App is aimed at people who are resident in Belgium and at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED?</h2>
<p>The App is designed to process as little personal data as possible. This means, for example, that
    the App does not collect any data that would allow SCIENSANO or other users to infer your
    identity, health status or location. In addition, the App deliberately refrains from using
    tracking tools to record or analyze how you use the App.</p>
<p>The data processed by the App can be grouped into the following categories:</p>
<h2>Access data</h2>
<p>Access data is generated when you use or enable the following features:</p>
<p>Exposure Logging</p>
<p>Sharing your test result.</p>
<p>Each time data is retrieved from the App’s server system, your IP address (on the upstream load
    balancer) is masked and no longer used within the App’s server system.</p>
<p>The following data is also processed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Date and time of retrieval (time stamp)</li>
    <li>Transmitted data volume (or packet length)</li>
    <li>Notification of successful retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<p>This access data is only processed to secure and maintain the technical infrastructure. You are
    not identified personally as a user of the App and it is not possible to create a user profile.
    The IP address will not be saved beyond the end of the period of use.</p>
<h2>Contact data</h2>
<p>If you enable exposure logging in your smartphone’s operating system, which serves to record
    encounters (contacts) with other users, then your smartphone will continuously send out randomly
    generated identification numbers (“random IDs”) via Bluetooth Low Energy, which other
    smartphones in your vicinity can receive if exposure logging is also enabled on them. Your
    smartphone, in turn, also receives the random IDs of the other smartphones. In addition to the
    random IDs received from other smartphones, your smartphone’s exposure logging functionality
    records and stores the following contact data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Date and time of the contact</li>
    <li>Duration of the contact</li>
    <li>Bluetooth signal strength of the contact</li>
    <li>Encrypted metadata (protocol version and transmission strength).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones as well as the other contact data
    (date and time of the contact, duration of the contact, signal strength of the contact and
    encrypted metadata) are recorded by your smartphone in an exposure log and currently stored
    there for 14 days.</p>
<p>The functionality used to record encounters with other users is called “COVID-19 Exposure
    Notifications” on Android smartphones and “COVID-19 Exposure Logging” on iPhones. Please note
    that this exposure logging functionality is not part of the App, but an integral part of your
    smartphone's operating system. This means that the exposure logging functionality is provided to
    you by Apple (iPhones) or Google (Android smartphones) and is subject to these companies’
    respective privacy policies. SCIENSANO has no influence on data processing performed by the
    operating system in connection with exposure logging.</p>
<p>The App will only process the contact data generated and stored by your smartphone if the App’s
    exposure logging feature is enabled.</p>
<h2>Health data</h2>
<p>Health data is any data containing information about the health of a particular individual. This
    includes not only information about past and current illnesses, but also about a person’s risk
    of illness (such as the risk that the person has been infected with the coronavirus).</p>
<p>The following cases involve processing health data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the exposure logging feature detects that you may have been in contact with a person who
        has been infected with the coronavirus.
    </li>
    <li>If you register your test.</li>
    <li>If you share a positive test result.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>APP FEATURES</h2>
<h2>EXPOSURE LOGGING</h2>
<p>The App’s core functionality is exposure logging. This serves to track possible contacts with
    other users of the App who are infected with the coronavirus, to evaluate the risk that you
    yourself have been infected, and – based on the risk identified – to provide you with health
    advice and recommendations for what to do next.</p>
<p>If you enable the exposure logging feature, then several times a day while the App runs in the
    background, the App will retrieve a list from the App’s server system of random IDs from users
    who have tested positive and shared their own random IDs.</p>
<p>The App shares these random IDs with your smartphone’s exposure logging functionality, which then
    compares them with the random IDs stored in your smartphone’s exposure log. If your smartphone’s
    exposure logging functionality detects a match, it transfers the contact data (date, duration,
    signal strength) to the App, but not the random ID of the contact in question.</p>
<p>In the event of a contact, the App analyses the contact data provided by the exposure logging
    functionality in order to determine your individual risk of infection.</p>
<p>The evaluation algorithm which determines how the contact data is interpreted (for example, how
    the duration of a contact influences the risk of infection) is based on current scientific
    findings. To account for new findings as and when they arise, SCIENSANO can update the
    evaluation algorithm by adjusting its settings. The settings for the evaluation algorithm are
    sent to the App together with the list of random IDs of infected users.</p>
<p>The identification of your risk of infection is only carried out locally on your smartphone,
    meaning that the data is processed offline. Once identified, the risk of infection is also only
    stored in the App and is not passed on to any other recipients (including SCIENSANO, Apple,
    Google and other third parties).</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of your access data, contact data and, if applicable, health
    data (if the App determines that you may have been infected) described above is your consent
    which you gave when enabling the exposure logging feature.</p>
<h2>REGISTERING A TEST</h2>
<p>If you have been tested for the coronavirus, you can register the test in the App. The app will
    then inform you as soon as the test result is available from the laboratory.</p>
<p>For this to work, the testing laboratory needs to be connected to the App’s server system and, as
    part of the testing procedure, you must have agreed separately to the laboratory transmitting
    your test result to the App’s server system (test result database). Test results from
    laboratories that are not connected to the App’s server system cannot be displayed in the App.
    If you have not received a QR code, the testing laboratory is not connected. In this case you
    will not be able to use this feature.</p>
<p>Registering a test</p>
<p>To receive the test result in the App, you must first register the test you have taken in the
    App. For this purpose, your doctor or the testing facility will provide you with a QR code when
    taking the sample. This QR code contains a code number which can be read with a QR code scanner.
    To register your test, you will need to scan the QR code in the App using your smartphone’s
    camera.</p>
<p>The code number read from the QR code is then hashed by the App, which means that the App
    performs a certain mathematical procedure in order to convert the code number in such a way that
    it can no longer be recognized. As soon as your smartphone is connected to the internet, the App
    will transmit the hashed code number to the App’s server system. In return, the App receives a
    token from the server system, i.e. a digital access key that is stored in the App. The token is
    linked to the hashed code number on the server system. The App then deletes the hashed code
    number on your smartphone. The server system will only issue a token once for each hashed code
    number. This ensures that your QR code cannot be used by other users of the App to retrieve test
    results.</p>
<p>This completes the registration of your test.</p>
<p>Filing of the test result</p>
<p>As soon as the testing laboratory receives the test result, it stores the result in the
    SCIENSANO’s test result database, indicating the hashed code number. The test result database is
    operated by SCIENSANO on a special server within the App’s server system. Based on the code
    number contained in the QR code issued to you, the testing laboratory also generates the hashed
    code number using the same mathematical procedure as the App.</p>
<p>Retrieval of the test result</p>
<p>Using the token, the App regularly requests the status of the registered test from the App’s
    server system. The server system then assigns the token to the hashed code number and transfers
    it to the test result database. If the test result has now been stored there, the test result
    database sends the test result back to the server system, which forwards it to the App without
    gaining any knowledge of the content.</p>
<p>If the test result is positive, the App uses the token again to request a TAN (transaction
    number) from the server system. The server system reassigns the token to the hashed code number
    and requests confirmation from the test result database that a positive test result exists for
    the hashed code number. If the test result database confirms this, the server system generates
    the TAN and transmits it to the App. A copy of the TAN remains on the server system.</p>
<p>The TAN is required to ensure that no false information is distributed to other users in the
    event of a positive test result being transmitted.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing described above of the data mentioned above is your consent to
    using the test registration feature.</p>
<h2>SHARING YOUR TEST RESULT</h2>
<p>If you use the feature for sharing your test result in order to warn other users, the App will
    transfer the random IDs generated and stored by your smartphone from the last 14 days and the
    TAN to the App’s server system. The server system first checks whether the TAN is valid and then
    adds your random IDs to the list of random IDs of users who have shared a positive test result.
    Your random IDs can now be downloaded by other users as part of the exposure logging
    process.</p>
<h2>USING THE APP FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY</h2>
<p>As long as you use the App for information purposes only, i.e. do not use any of the App features
    mentioned above and do not enter any data, then processing only takes place locally on your
    smartphone and no personal data is generated. Websites linked in the app will open in your
    smartphone’s standard browser. The data processed here depends on the browser used, your browser
    settings, and the data processing practices of the website you are visiting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WHAT PERMISSIONS AND FUNCTIONALITY DOES THE APP REQUIRE?</h2>
<p>The App requires access to a number of your smartphone’s features and interfaces. For this
    purpose, you need to grant the App certain permissions. Permissions are programmed differently
    by different manufacturers. For example, individual permissions may be combined into permission
    categories, where you can only agree to the permission category as a whole. Please note that if
    the App is denied access, you will not be able to use any or all of the App’s features.</p>
<h2>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (ALL SMARTPHONES)</h2>
<p>Internet The App requires an internet connection for the exposure logging feature, and so that it
    can receive and transmit test results, so that it can communicate with the App’s server
    system.</p>
<p>Bluetooth Your smartphone’s Bluetooth interface must be enabled for your smartphone to record
    random IDs from other smartphones and store them in the device’s exposure log.</p>
<p>Background operation</p>
<p>The App runs in the background (i.e. when you are not actively using the App) in order to be able
    to automatically identify your risk and query the status of a registered test. If you deny the
    App permission to run in the background in your smartphone’s operating system, then you must
    start all actions in the App itself.</p>
<h2>ANDROID SMARTPHONES</h2>
<p>If you are using an Android device, the following system features must also be enabled:</p>
<p>COVID-19 Exposure Notifications</p>
<p>The App’s exposure logging feature requires this functionality. Otherwise, no exposure log with
    the random IDs of your contacts will be available. The functionality must be enabled within the
    App to allow the App to access the exposure log.</p>
<p>Location Your smartphone’s location service must be enabled for your device to search for
    Bluetooth signals from other smartphones. Please note that no location data is collected in this
    process.</p>
<p>Notification The user is notified locally of the identified risk and available test results. The
    necessary notification function is already enabled in the operating system.</p>
<p>The App also requires the following permissions:</p>
<h2>IPHONES (APPLE IOS)</h2>
<p>If you are using an iPhone, the following system features must be enabled:</p>
<p>COVID-19 Exposure Logging</p>
<p>The App’s exposure logging feature requires this functionality, otherwise no exposure log with
    the random IDs of your contacts will be available. The functionality must be enabled within the
    App to allow the App to access the exposure log.</p>
<p>Notifications The user is notified locally of the identified risk and available test results.
    Notifications must be enabled for this.</p>
<h2>WHEN WILL DATA BE DELETED?</h2>
<p>All data stored in the App is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for the App features:</p>
<h2>Exposure Logging</h2>
<p>The list of random IDs of users who have shared a positive test result will be deleted from the
    App immediately, and also automatically deleted from your smartphone’s exposure log after 14
    days.</p>
<p>SCIENSANO has no way of influencing the deletion of contact data in your smartphone’s exposure
    log (including your own random IDs) and contact data on other smartphones, as this functionality
    is provided by Apple or Google. In this case, the deletion depends on what Apple or Google has
    determined. Currently, the data is automatically deleted after 14 days. It may also be possible,
    using the functionality provided by Apple and Google, to manually delete data in your device’s
    system settings.</p>
<p>The risk status displayed in the App will be deleted as soon as a new risk status has been
    determined. A new risk status is usually determined after the App has received a new list of
    random IDs.</p>
<h2>Registering a test</h2>
<p>The hashed code number will be deleted from the App’s server system after 21 days.</p>
<p>In the event of a negative test result, the hashed code number and the test result will be
    deleted from the test result database immediately after the test result is retrieved; and in the
    event of a positive test result, they will be deleted immediately after the copy of the TAN
    stored on the server system is deleted (see below).</p>
<p>The token stored on the server system will be deleted after 21 days.</p>
<p>The token stored in the app will be deleted from the smartphone after the App is deleted or after
    using the feature for sharing the test result.</p>
<h2>Sharing your test result</h2>
<p>Your smartphone’s own random IDs which are shared in the App will be deleted from the server
    system after 14 days.</p>
<p>The copy of the TAN stored on the server system will be deleted after 21 days.</p>
<p>The TAN stored in the App will be deleted after the test result has been shared.</p>
<p>The TeleTAN stored in the App will be deleted after the test result has been shared.</p>
<p>The TeleTAN stored on the server system will be deleted after 21 days.</p>
<p>The TeleTAN sent to the hotline employee will be deleted there immediately after it has been
    passed on to you by telephone.</p>
<p>The token stored on the server system will be deleted after 21 days.</p>
<p>The token stored in the App will be deleted after the test result has been shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WHO WILL RECEIVE YOUR DATA?</h2>
<p>If you share a test result to warn other users, your random IDs from the last 14 days will be
    passed on to the App on other users’ smartphones.</p>
<p>SCIENSANO has commissioned DEVSIDE SRL to operate and maintain part of the technical
    infrastructure of the App, meaning that these company is processor under data protection law and
    acting on SCIENSANO’s behalf (Article 28 GDPR).</p>
<p>Otherwise, SCIENSANO will only pass on personal data collected in connection with your use of the
    App to third parties if the SCIENSANO is legally obliged to do so or if this is necessary for
    legal action or criminal prosecution in the case of attacks on the App’s technical
    infrastructure. In other cases, personal data will not generally be passed on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>IS DATA TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD COUNTRY?</h2>
<p>The data generated when the App is used is processed exclusively on servers in Belgium or in
    another EU or EEA member state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT</h2>
<p>You have the right to withdraw any consent you granted SCIENSANO in the App at any time with
    effect for the future. Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
    before the withdrawal.</p>
<p>To withdraw your consent to the exposure logging feature, you can disable the feature using the
    toggle switch in the App or delete the App. If you decide to use the exposure logging feature
    again, you can toggle the feature back on or reinstall the App.</p>
<p>To withdraw your consent to the test registration feature, you can delete the test registration
    in the App. The token for retrieving the test result will then be deleted from your device.
    Neither SCIENSANO nor the testing laboratory can then assign the transmitted data to your App or
    smartphone. If you wish to register another test, you will be asked to grant your consent
    again.</p>
<p>To withdraw your consent to the sharing of your test result, you must delete the App. All of your
    random IDs stored in the App will then be removed and can no longer be assigned to your
    smartphone. If you wish to report another test result, you can reinstall the App and grant your
    consent again. Alternatively, you may be able to delete your own random IDs in the exposure log
    in your smartphone’s system settings. Please note that, once transmitted, SCIENSANO has no way
    of deleting your random IDs from the lists and from other users’ smartphones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>YOUR OTHER RIGHTS UNDER DATA PROTECTION LAW</h2>
<p>If SCIENSANO processes your personal data, you also have the following data protection
    rights:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the rights under Articles 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21 GDPR;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>the right to contact the official SCIENSANO data protection officer&nbsp;and raise your
        concerns (Article 38(4) GDPR) and
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority. To do so, you can
        either contact your local supervisory authority or the competent authority at the
        SCIENSANO’s headquarters. The competent supervisory authority for SCIENSANO is the Data
        Protection Authority, Rue de la Presse 35, 1000 Bruxelles (Belgium) (+ 32 (0)2 274 48 00 +32
        (0)2 274 48 35 <a href="mailto:contact@apd-gba.be">contact@apd-gba.be</a>&nbsp;/ <a
                href="https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be">https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that &nbsp;SCIENSANO can only fulfil the rights mentioned above if the data on which
    your claim is based can be clearly assigned to you. This would only be possible if SCIENSANO
    were to collect further personal data that would allow the data mentioned above to be clearly
    assigned to you or your smartphone. Since this is not necessary – and not intended – for the
    purposes of the App, SCIENSANO is not obliged to collect such additional data (Article 11(2)
    GDPR). Moreover, this would run counter to the stated objective of keeping the amount of data
    processed for the App as low as possible. Against this backdrop, it will not normally be
    possible to directly fulfil the above data protection rights under Articles 15, 16, 17, 18, 20
    and 21 GDPR, as doing so would require additional information about you which is not available
    to SCIENSANO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
