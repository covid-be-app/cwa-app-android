    <p>
        The precise operation of Coronalert and the underlying databases, and the responsibilities
        in that respect, are regulated by the Cooperation agreement of 25 August 2020 between:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>the Federal State</li>
        <li>the Flemish Community</li>
        <li>the Walloon Region</li>
        <li>the German-speaking Community</li>
        <li>the Joint Community Commission</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        concerning the joint processing of data by Sciensano and the contact centres, health
        inspections and mobile teams designated by the competent federated entities or by the
        competent agencies within the framework of a contact investigation of persons (presumed) to
        be infected with the coronavirus COVID-19 on the basis of a database at Sciensano.
    </p>
    <p>
        This cooperation agreement regulates the databases used, in particular Article 14. For the
        sake of readability, this text systematically refers to Sciensano as the person responsible
        for processing the databases. This is without prejudice to the fact that the regulations
        referred to assign certain responsibilities in respect of the app itself to the federated
        entities.
    </p>

<section>
    <p>
        This Contact Tracing App was developed in the context of the Coronavirus
        outbreak and pursuant to an initiative&nbsp;from the Belgian Government and
        federated entities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App is based on a proximity tracing system called
        "Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing" ("DP-3T system")
        developed by an international consortium of technologists, legal experts,
        engineers and epidemiologists from various universities. More detailed
        information about the DP-3T system is publicly available at
        https://github.com/DP-3T/documents. In addition, the Contact Tracing App uses
        the Exposure Notification System created by Google and Apple. This Exposure
        Notification System allows the Contact Tracing App to send notifications to
        the user as further explained below. More information on the Exposure
        Notification System is available at
        https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of the Contact Tracing App is completely voluntary. In other words,
        there is no obligation whatsoever to install this Contact Tracing App.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App is intended to be used in any country that also uses a
        DP-3T system. This means that if a user of the Belgian Contact Tracing App
        visits such a country, s/he&nbsp;can also receive notifications that
        s/he&nbsp;has been at risk in such a country.

    <h2>Who is the controller for the contact tracing app?</h2>
    <p>
        This Contact Tracing App is regulated by the Samenwerkingsakkoord van 25 augustus 2020
        tussen de Federale staat, de Vlaamse Gemeenschap, het Waalse Gewest, de Duitstalige
        Gemeenschap en de Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, betreffende de gezamenlijke
        gegevensverwerking door Sciensano en de door de bevoegde gefedereerde entiteiten of door de
        bevoegde agentschappen aangeduide contactcentra, gezondheidsinspecties en mobiele teams in
        het kader van een contactonderzoek bij personen die (vermoedelijk) met het coronavirus
        COVID-19 besmet zijn op basis van een gegevensbank bij Sciensano (herinafter referred to as
        “Cooperation agreement of 25 August 2020”).
    </p>
    <p>
        This Contact Tracing App is offered by the regional health administrations and
        Sciensano is responsible for the server infrastructure of the app.
        &nbsp;Sciensano is a public institution with legal personality established by
        the Act of 25 February 2018 regarding the establishment of Sciensano, with
        registered office at rue Juliette Wytsman 14, B-1050 Ixelles and registered
        with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises under the number 0693.876.830
        (hereinafter referred to as "Sciensano").
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the Cooperation Agreement of 25 August 2020, Sciensano acts as data controller
        with regard to the collection and processing of personal data within the meaning of the
        General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as “GDPR”).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sciensano can be contacted via mail at the address stated above and by email
        at coronalert@sciensano.be.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has appointed a Data Protection Officer who can be contacted at
        dpo@sciensano.be.

    <h2>What is the purpose of the contact tracing app and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>Proximity tracing</p>
    <p>
        The purpose of the Contact Tracing App is to inform citizens who have been in
        close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the
        virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where and when the contact
        occurred. The various processing of personal data performed in the framework
        of this notification process and in the framework of the registration as user
        of the Contact Tracing App are based on grounds of public interest&nbsp;(art.
        6.1 (e) GDPR) and, as far as data relating to health are concerned, grounds of
        public interest in the area of public health&nbsp;(9.2 (i)&nbsp;GDPR). The
        Contact Tracing App is regulated by the Royal Decree nr 44. Processing
        activities are indeed carried out in the public interest as they aim at
        containing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting the population against this
        epidemic.
    </p>
    <p>
        To achieve this goal the Contact Tracing App generates secret keys and
        computes from these keys ephemeral (in other words, temporary), random ID
        which represent the user's phone. These IDs are ephemeral because they refresh
        at a high frequency (every 10-20 minutes), i.e. at the same frequency as the
        Bluetooth MAC address (i.e. the temporary identifiers that Bluetooth devices
        use to indicate the originator or recipient of messages).
    </p>
    <p>
        The user’s phone broadcasts these random IDs and also records the random IDs
        observed from other phones that are nearby and stores these for 14 days
        together with the date, the signal strength and the duration.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be tested for COVID-19, a user has to contact a health care practitioner
        who will take a sample. Either the health care practitioner of the user
        her/himself will register a pseudonymous identifier from the user’s phone in
        the testing server. From then on, the Contact Tracing App will regularly check
        the testing server, by means of this anonymous identifier, to see whether the
        test result is available. Once the test result is available, the Contact
        Tracing App will inform the user about the test result: negative or positive.
        If the result is positive, the user should contact the health practitioner.
        The user can then decide to upload the Secret Keys to generate the random IDs
        previously broadcasted (as further described in section 4) to the central
        server. In order to minimize incorrect use, this upload will be authorized by
        the testing server that sends an authorization code to the central server.
        Subsequently, immediately after the upload, all these Secret Keys are removed
        from the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Except if they are&nbsp;uploaded, the Secret Keys to generate the broadcasted
        random IDs remain on the phone for a period of maximum 14 days. The recorded
        random IDs of other users never leave the phone&nbsp;and are destroyed after
        14 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the Secret Keys to generate the broadcasted random IDs are uploaded by an
        infected user to the central server, the Contact Tracing App of other users
        can retrieve these Secret Keys from the server to assess whether such other
        users were exposed to the virus through close-range proximity to a COVID-19
        positive person who has uploaded its data. If&nbsp;the Contact Tracing App
        retrieving the data from the server detects a substantial&nbsp;risk for
        infection&nbsp;(i.e. the user has been near a COVID-19 positive person during
        a period of at least 15 minutes), it will inform the user of the Contract
        Tracing App and recommend certain actions by means of a push notification
        generated by the Contact Tracing App. It is the sole responsibility of the
        user to follow upon on these recommendations.
    </p>
    <p>For clarity and avoidance of doubt, the Contact Tracing App does NOT:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            monitor compliance with any government imposed quarantine, confinement or
            social distancing measures;
        </li>
        <li>track COVID-19 positive patients;</li>
        <li>
            transmit in real-time &nbsp;information about a high-risk contact with a
            positive patient;
        </li>
        <li>send any information about users without a positive test result; nor</li>
        <li>identify hotspots or trajectories of COVID-19 positive patients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Limited processing for statistical purposes</p>
    <p>
        On the basis of the information uploaded to the central server, Sciensano may
        compile limited aggregated statistics such as counting the number of keys
        uploaded per day and the number of people using the Contract Tracing App who
        have tested positive each day. Sciensano will only generate those figures
        based on previously anonymised data. Sciensano has no access to the names,
        phone numbers or other "personal data" provided by the users or generated by
        the use of the Contact Tracing App.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What personal data are collected and processed when using the contact tracing
        app?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The DP-3T system is specifically designed to minimise data collection and
        processing. When using the Contact Tracing App, only data that allow informing
        the user that s/he might have been exposed to the virus are collected. The
        Contact Tracing App does not reveal to the user who the potential contagious
        contact was, or when exactly and where the contact happened.
    </p>
    <p>
        A detailed description of the collected data is given below. The collected
        data does not allow identifying individuals directly or indirectly. Sciensano
        has no access to the names of the users of the Contact Tracing App nor to
        other personal data allowing identifying them (telephone number, national
        registry number, IP address etc.). However, it cannot be excluded that, for
        example, a user who is notified that s/he has been in close contact with an
        individual tested positive for COVID-19 may identify that individual.
        Therefore, the data is generally considered personal data, albeit
        pseudonymised. The keys and random IDs (as further explained below) qualify as
        health-related data when (i) the Contact Tracing App determines that a person
        is at risk of infection, (ii) the person records a test, and (iii) the person
        shares a positive test result.
    </p>
    <p>Secret Key</p>
    <p>
        Upon installation, the Contact Tracing App generates every day a secret key
        (further ‘Secret Key’) which is stored on the phone&nbsp;of the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Secret Key is shared with all other users to determine whether a
        potentially infectious contact has taken place if the user notifies that s/he
        has been diagnosed with COVID-19 by uploading this information to the central
        server as described in paragraph 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        To protect the privacy of the users and to reduce the risk of singling out the
        persons that are uploading Secret Keys after having been diagnosed with
        COVID-19, the Contract Tracing App of every user uploads a dummy Secret Key
        (on average every 5 days) to the central server.
    </p>
    <p>Ephemeral random Identifiers (IDs)</p>
    <p>
        Phones with the Contact Tracing App installed broadcast random Identifiers,
        being combinations of ones and zeros, via Bluetooth. These IDs are computed
        from the Secret Keys. Once broadcasted, these IDs are deleted from the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        The phone receives the IDs that are broadcasted by nearby phones and locally
        stores the received IDs with the following information: received ID, signal
        strength, duration and date.
    </p>
    <p>
        These records of the received IDs are stored on the phone&nbsp;and never sent
        to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>Lab test result data</p>
    <p>
        Users have the possibility to demand the result of their COVID-19 lab test via
        the app that connects to the test result server.
    </p>
    <p>IP Address</p>
    <p>
        IP addresses of users who download/upload keys are explicitly removed from any
        logs or storage. In the Belgian architecture a PROXY server takes care of
        removal of the IP address of the uploader (alternatively the server does it
        itself and this is to be audited).
    </p>
    <p>Traffic data about the upload</p>
    <p>
        Users who upload their Secret Keys to the central server will do so via the
        web service&nbsp;together with the date on which the Secret Key was
        used&nbsp;and&nbsp;the estimated date on which the user became contagious.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App does not collect location data. However, the user may indicate
        him/herself within the Contact Tracing App in which country/ies s/he has been at a certain
        date for reasons of interoperability with other countries’ contact tracing apps. In this
        case, the Secret Key will be sent to the country indicated by the user. This means that it
        is sent to the “European Federation Gateway Service”, and from there on to the backoffice of
        the app of the country where the key was used (counterpart to Sciensano) and from there on
        to all app users of that country. The technical and organisational details of this European
        cooperation are laid down in an EU Commission Decision (Commission Implementing Decision
        (EU) 2020/1023 of 15 July 2020, which is available at
        https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2020/1023/oj). For more information on the “European
        Federation Gateway Service”, please visit https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/covid-19_en.
        For more information on the identity of the joint controller responsible for the contact
        tracing app per country, please visit
        https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/gateway_jointcontrollers_en.pdf.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only users for which the testing server has sent an authorisation code (after
        confirmation that the user has been tested positive) to the central
        server&nbsp;will be able to successfully upload data to the central server.
    </p>
    <p>Authorisation code</p>
    <p>
        When a user is tested COVID-19 positive, the testing server will send&nbsp;an
        authorisation code to the central server. When a user wants to upload his/her
        Secret Keys, the central server checks whether it has received an
        authorization code for this specific user. If the central server has indeed
        received an authorization code for this specific user, the user will be able
        to upload the Secret Keys.
    </p>
    <p>Visited countries</p>
    <p>
        The user may choose to indicate within the Contact Tracing App which countries
        s/he has visited. Besides this, the Contact Tracing App does not collect nor
        process any other location data.
    </p>
    <p>Personal data of children</p>
    <p>
        Taking into account the fact that the Contact Tracing App is aimed at
        protecting health and given the guarantees provided to greatly reduce the
        risks for users of the app (voluntary use, limited and pseudonymised data,
        reduced data storage time), it has been considered that from the age of 13 a
        child can consent alone to the installation of the application. Below this
        age, the consent of the legal representative is required.
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>
    <h2>Does the contact tracing app take automated decisions?</h2>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App does not take any automated decisions with regard to a
        user within the meaning of article 22 of the General Data Protection
        Regulation.
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>
    <h2>With whom are personal (pseudonymous) data shared?</h2>
    <p>Upload to the central server</p>
    <p>
        As described in paragraphs 3 and 4 the user may upload data to the central
        server. This central server is hosted by Sciensano in the European Union.
    </p>
    <p>
        The central server only stores information of infected users if they decide to
        upload the Secret Keys&nbsp;to this server.
    </p>
    <p>Distribution to all apps</p>
    <p>
        As described in paragraphs 3 and 4 the keys uploaded to the central server are
        distributed on a daily basis to all apps. For efficiency reasons, this
        distribution can take place through a Content Distribution Network, i.e. a
        replication service that makes sure that everyone receives the same data
        without overloading the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharing of personal data with national&nbsp;providers of European databases
        related to&nbsp;similar contact tracing apps in other countries
    </p>
    <p>
        If the user indicates in the Contract Tracing App that s/he has visited
        another EU country, the Secret Keys may be sent to the central servers of
        similar contract tracing apps in those EU countries directly or via the EU
        gateway, i.e. a server that forwards these keys to the other EU servers. A key
        gets only forwarded to country A if a user indicates she has visited country
        A.
    </p>
    <p>Sharing of personal data with ICT-providers</p>
    <p>
        By installing the Contact Tracing App,&nbsp;Google and Apple are able to see
        who installed the Contact Tracing App. However, they ensure that the system
        does not share the identity of users with them.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>
        Are personal data transferred to countries outside of the european union?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Personal data are not transferred to countries outside of the European
        Union.&nbsp;
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>
    <h2>How long are the personal data kept?</h2>
    <p>
        The personal data stored on each user's phone&nbsp;and on the central server
        are automatically removed after 14 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contact Tracing App will in any case be deactivated at the date determined
        by the applicable Belgian law.
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>
    <h2>How are the personal data protected?</h2>
    <p>
        The developers of the DP-3T system have attached great importance to the
        protection of personal data. The DP-3T system provides for the following
        privacy and security protections:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The system is designed to comply with state-of-the art cryptographic
            techniques and measures.
        </li>
        <li>
            All transmission of personal data are protected by encryption and
            authenticated when necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Personal data is mainly stored on the user's phone&nbsp;and only limited
            information is sent to the central server if the user decides to send it
            (decentralized approach).
        </li>
        <li>
            The decentralized approach mitigates the risk of misuse of the personal data
            by a central authority.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition, the central server is protected by appropriate technical and
        organisational measures including strict access management.
    </p>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section>
    <h2>What rights do users have?</h2>
    <p>
        Under the conditions provided for in the General Data Protection Regulation,
        users have the right to access their personal data, request rectification,
        erasure or restriction of the processing or object to the processing of their
        personal data (“data subject rights”).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sciensano will only be able to respond to requests from users where it will be
        able to link the data processed in the context of the Contact Tracing App to
        the specific user. To be able to link the data to the user, Sciensano would
        need to obtain additional data. As the Contact Tracing App is built on
        technology aiming at protecting the privacy of the users as much as possible,
        it is not desirable that Sciensano processes additional data merely to
        identify the user. Pursuant to article 11 GDPR, Sciensano cannot be obliged to
        process such additional data to identify the user for the sole purpose of
        complying with the data subject rights under the GDPR. This means that in
        practice, users will not be able to exercise their data subject rights unless
        additional information is provided to Sciensano.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users have the right to lodge a complaint with the Belgian Supervisory
        Authority (https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be /
        https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be /
        https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be).
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Amendments to this privacy statement</h2>
    <p>
        Sciensano may amend this privacy statement from time to time in which case,
        Sciensano will inform the user of such change by means of a notification in
        the Contact Tracing App.
