<p>
    This Contact Tracing App was developed in the context of the Coronavirus
    outbreak and pursuant to an initiative&nbsp;from the Belgian Government and
    federated entities.
</p>
<p>
    The Contact Tracing App is based on a proximity tracing system called
    "Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing" ("DP-3T system")
    developed by an international consortium of technologists, legal experts,
    engineers and epidemiologists from various universities. More detailed
    information about the DP-3T system is publicly available at
    https://github.com/DP-3T/documents. In addition, the Contact Tracing App uses
    the Exposure Notification System created by Google and Apple. This Exposure
    Notification System allows the Contact Tracing App to send notifications to
    the user as further explained below. More information on the Exposure
    Notification System is available at
    https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/.
</p>
<p>
    The use of the Contact Tracing App is completely voluntary. In other words,
    there is no obligation whatsoever to install this Contact Tracing App.
</p>
<p>
    The Contact Tracing App is intended to be used in any country that also uses a
    DP-3T system. This means that if a user of the Belgian Contact Tracing App
    visits such a country, s/he&nbsp;can also receive notifications that
    s/he&nbsp;has been at risk in such a country.
</p>
<h2>Who is the controller for the contact tracing app?</h2>
<p>
    This Contact Tracing App is regulated by the Royal Decree nr 44 of June 26,
    2020 “betreffende de gezamenlijke gegevensverwerking door Sciensano en de door
    de bevoegde regionale overheden of door de bevoegde agentschappen aangeduide
    contactcentra, gezondheidsinspecties en mobiele teams in het kader van een
    contactonderzoek bij personen die (vermoedelijk) met het coronavirus COVID-19
    besmet zijn op basis van een gegevensbank bij Sciensano” (herinafter referred
    to as “Royal Decree nr 44”).
</p>
<p>
    This Contact Tracing App is offered by the regional health administrations and
    Sciensano is responsible for the server infrastructure of the app.
    &nbsp;Sciensano is a public institution with legal personality established by
    the Act of 25 February 2018 regarding the establishment of Sciensano, with
    registered office at rue Juliette Wytsman 14, B-1050 Ixelles and registered
    with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises under the number 0693.876.830
    (hereinafter referred to as "Sciensano").
</p>
<p>
    According to the Royal Decree nr 44, Sciensano acts as data controller with
    regard to the collection and processing of personal data within the meaning of
    the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as
    “GDPR”).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Sciensano can be contacted via mail at the address stated above and by email
    at coronalert@sciensano.be.
</p>
<p>
    It has appointed a Data Protection Officer who can be contacted at
    dpo@sciensano.be.
</p>
<h2>What is the purpose of the contact tracing app and how does it work?</h2>
<p>Proximity tracing</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the Contact Tracing App is to inform citizens who have been in
    close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the
    virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where and when the contact
    occurred. The various processing of personal data performed in the framework
    of this notification process and in the framework of the registration as user
    of the Contact Tracing App are based on grounds of public interest&nbsp;(art.
    6.1 (e) GDPR) and, as far as data relating to health are concerned, grounds of
    public interest in the area of public health&nbsp;(9.2 (i)&nbsp;GDPR). The
    Contact Tracing App is regulated by the Royal Decree nr 44. Processing
    activities are indeed carried out in the public interest as they aim at
    containing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting the population against this
    epidemic.
</p>
<p>
    To achieve this goal the Contact Tracing App generates secret keys and
    computes from these keys ephemeral (in other words, temporary), random ID
    which represent the user's phone. These IDs are ephemeral because they refresh
    at a high frequency (every 10-20 minutes), i.e. at the same frequency as the
    Bluetooth MAC address (i.e. the temporary identifiers that Bluetooth devices
    use to indicate the originator or recipient of messages).
</p>
<p>
    The user’s phone broadcasts these random IDs and also records the random IDs
    observed from other phones that are nearby and stores these for 14 days
    together with the date, the signal strength and the duration.
</p>
<p>
    To be tested for COVID-19, a user has to contact a health care practitioner
    who will take a sample. Either the health care practitioner of the user
    her/himself will register a pseudonymous identifier from the user’s phone in
    the testing server. From then on, the Contact Tracing App will regularly check
    the testing server, by means of this anonymous identifier, to see whether the
    test result is available. Once the test result is available, the Contact
    Tracing App will inform the user about the test result: negative or positive.
    If the result is positive, the user should contact the health practitioner.
    The user can then decide to upload the Secret Keys to generate the random IDs
    previously broadcasted (as further described in section 4) to the central
    server. In order to minimize incorrect use, this upload will be authorized by
    the testing server that sends an authorization code to the central server.
    Subsequently, immediately after the upload, all these Secret Keys are removed
    from the phone.
</p>
<p>
    Except if they are&nbsp;uploaded, the Secret Keys to generate the broadcasted
    random IDs remain on the phone for a period of maximum 14 days. The recorded
    random IDs of other users never leave the phone&nbsp;and are destroyed after
    14 days.
</p>
<p>
    Once the Secret Keys to generate the broadcasted random IDs are uploaded by an
    infected user to the central server, the Contact Tracing App of other users
    can retrieve these Secret Keys from the server to assess whether such other
    users were exposed to the virus through close-range proximity to a COVID-19
    positive person who has uploaded its data. If&nbsp;the Contact Tracing App
    retrieving the data from the server detects a substantial&nbsp;risk for
    infection&nbsp;(i.e. the user has been near a COVID-19 positive person during
    a period of at least 15 minutes), it will inform the user of the Contract
    Tracing App and recommend certain actions by means of a push notification
    generated by the Contact Tracing App. It is the sole responsibility of the
    user to follow upon on these recommendations.
</p>
<p>For clarity and avoidance of doubt, the Contact Tracing App does NOT:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        monitor compliance with any government imposed quarantine, confinement or
        social distancing measures;
    </li>
    <li>track COVID-19 positive patients;</li>
    <li>
        transmit in real-time &nbsp;information about a high-risk contact with a
        positive patient;
    </li>
    <li>send any information about users without a positive test result; nor</li>
    <li>identify hotspots or trajectories of COVID-19 positive patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limited processing for statistical purposes</p>
<p>
    On the basis of the information uploaded to the central server, Sciensano may
    compile limited aggregated statistics such as counting the number of keys
    uploaded per day and the number of people using the Contract Tracing App who
    have tested positive each day. Sciensano will only generate those figures
    based on previously anonymised data. Sciensano has no access to the names,
    phone numbers or other "personal data" provided by the users or generated by
    the use of the Contact Tracing App.
</p>
<h2>
    What personal data are collected and processed when using the contact tracing
    app?
</h2>
<p>
    The DP-3T system is specifically designed to minimise data collection and
    processing. When using the Contact Tracing App, only data that allow informing
    the user that s/he might have been exposed to the virus are collected. The
    Contact Tracing App does not reveal to the user who the potential contagious
    contact was, or when exactly and where the contact happened.
</p>
<p>
    A detailed description of the collected data is given below. The collected
    data does not allow identifying individuals directly or indirectly. Sciensano
    has no access to the names of the users of the Contact Tracing App nor to
    other personal data allowing identifying them (telephone number, national
    registry number, IP address etc.). However, it cannot be excluded that, for
    example, a user who is notified that s/he has been in close contact with an
    individual tested positive for COVID-19 may identify that individual.
    Therefore, the data is generally considered personal data, albeit
    pseudonymised. The keys and random IDs (as further explained below) qualify as
    health-related data when (i) the Contact Tracing App determines that a person
    is at risk of infection, (ii) the person records a test, and (iii) the person
    shares a positive test result.
</p>
<p>Secret Key</p>
<p>
    Upon installation, the Contact Tracing App generates every day a secret key
    (further ‘Secret Key’) which is stored on the phone&nbsp;of the user.
</p>
<p>
    The Secret Key is shared with all other users to determine whether a
    potentially infectious contact has taken place if the user notifies that s/he
    has been diagnosed with COVID-19 by uploading this information to the central
    server as described in paragraph 3.
</p>
<p>
    To protect the privacy of the users and to reduce the risk of singling out the
    persons that are uploading Secret Keys after having been diagnosed with
    COVID-19, the Contract Tracing App of every user uploads a dummy Secret Key
    (on average every 5 days) to the central server.
</p>
<p>Ephemeral random Identifiers (IDs)</p>
<p>
    Phones with the Contact Tracing App installed broadcast random Identifiers,
    being combinations of ones and zeros, via Bluetooth. These IDs are computed
    from the Secret Keys. Once broadcasted, these IDs are deleted from the phone.
</p>
<p>
    The phone receives the IDs that are broadcasted by nearby phones and locally
    stores the received IDs with the following information: received ID, signal
    strength, duration and date.
</p>
<p>
    These records of the received IDs are stored on the phone&nbsp;and never sent
    to anyone.
</p>
<p>Lab test result data</p>
<p>
    Users have the possibility to demand the result of their COVID-19 lab test via
    the app that connects to the test result server.
</p>
<p>IP Address</p>
<p>
    IP addresses of users who download/upload keys are explicitly removed from any
    logs or storage. In the Belgian architecture a PROXY server takes care of
    removal of the IP address of the uploader (alternatively the server does it
    itself and this is to be audited).
</p>
<p>Traffic data about the upload</p>
<p>
    Users who upload their Secret Keys to the central server will do so via the
    web service&nbsp;together with the date on which the Secret Key was
    used&nbsp;and&nbsp;the estimated date on which the user became contagious.
</p>
<p>
    The Contact Tracing App does not collect location data. However, the user may
    indicate him/herself within the Contact Tracing App in which country/ies s/he
    has been at a certain date for reasons of interoperability with other
    countries' contact tracing apps.&nbsp;In this case, the Secret Key will be
    sent to the country indicated by the user. This means that it is sent to the
    “European Federation Gateway Service”, and from there on to the backoffice of
    the app of the country where the key was used (counterpart to Sciensano) and
    from there on to all app users of that country
</p>
<p>
    Only users for which the testing server has sent an authorisation code (after
    confirmation that the user has been tested positive) to the central
    server&nbsp;will be able to successfully upload data to the central server.
</p>
<p>Authorisation code</p>
<p>
    When a user is tested COVID-19 positive, the testing server will send&nbsp;an
    authorisation code to the central server. When a user wants to upload his/her
    Secret Keys, the central server checks whether it has received an
    authorization code for this specific user. If the central server has indeed
    received an authorization code for this specific user, the user will be able
    to upload the Secret Keys.
</p>
<p>Visited countries</p>
<p>
    The user may choose to indicate within the Contact Tracing App which countries
    s/he has visited. Besides this, the Contact Tracing App does not collect nor
    process any other location data.
</p>
<p>Personal data of children</p>
<p>
    Taking into account the fact that the Contact Tracing App is aimed at
    protecting health and given the guarantees provided to greatly reduce the
    risks for users of the app (voluntary use, limited and pseudonymised data,
    reduced data storage time), it has been considered that from the age of 13 a
    child can consent alone to the installation of the application. Below this
    age, the consent of the legal representative is required.
</p>
<h2>Does the contact tracing app take automated decisions?</h2>
<p>
    The Contact Tracing App does not take any automated decisions with regard to a
    user within the meaning of article 22 of the General Data Protection
    Regulation.
</p>
<h2>With whom are personal (pseudonymous) data shared?</h2>
<p>Upload to the central server</p>
<p>
    As described in paragraphs 3 and 4 the user may upload data to the central
    server. This central server is hosted by Sciensano in Belgium.
</p>
<p>
    The central server only stores information of infected users if they decide to
    upload the Secret Keys&nbsp;to this server.
</p>
<p>Distribution to all apps</p>
<p>
    As described in paragraphs 3 and 4 the keys uploaded to the central server are
    distributed on a daily basis to all apps. For efficiency reasons, this
    distribution can take place through a Content Distribution Network, i.e. a
    replication service that makes sure that everyone receives the same data
    without overloading the network.
</p>
<p>
    Sharing of personal data with national&nbsp;providers of European databases
    related to&nbsp;similar contact tracing apps in other countries
</p>
<p>
    If the user indicates in the Contract Tracing App that s/he has visited
    another EU country, the Secret Keys may be sent to the central servers of
    similar contract tracing apps in those EU countries directly or via the EU
    gateway, i.e. a server that forwards these keys to the other EU servers. A key
    gets only forwarded to country A if a user indicates she has visited country
    A.
</p>
<p>Sharing of personal data with ICT-providers</p>
<p>
    By installing the Contact Tracing App,&nbsp;Google and Apple are able to see
    who installed the Contact Tracing App. However, they ensure that the system
    does not share the identity of users with them.
</p>
<h2>
    Are personal data transferred to countries outside of the european union?
</h2>
<p>
    Personal data are not transferred to countries outside of the European
    Union.&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>How long are the personal data kept?</h2>
<p>
    The personal data stored on each user's phone&nbsp;and on the central server
    are automatically removed after 14 days.
</p>
<p>
    The Contact Tracing App will in any case be deactivated at the date determined
    by the applicable Belgian law.
</p>
<h2>How are the personal data protected?</h2>
<p>
    The developers of the DP-3T system have attached great importance to the
    protection of personal data. The DP-3T system provides for the following
    privacy and security protections:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The system is designed to comply with state-of-the art cryptographic
        techniques and measures.
    </li>
    <li>
        All transmission of personal data are protected by encryption and
        authenticated when necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Personal data is mainly stored on the user's phone&nbsp;and only limited
        information is sent to the central server if the user decides to send it
        (decentralized approach).
    </li>
    <li>
        The decentralized approach mitigates the risk of misuse of the personal data
        by a central authority.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, the central server is protected by appropriate technical and
    organisational measures including strict access management.
</p>
<h2>What rights do users have?</h2>
<p>
    Under the conditions provided for in the General Data Protection Regulation,
    users have the right to access their personal data, request rectification,
    erasure or restriction of the processing or object to the processing of their
    personal data (“data subject rights”).
</p>
<p>
    Sciensano will only be able to respond to requests from users where it will be
    able to link the data processed in the context of the Contact Tracing App to
    the specific user. To be able to link the data to the user, Sciensano would
    need to obtain additional data. As the Contact Tracing App is built on
    technology aiming at protecting the privacy of the users as much as possible,
    it is not desirable that Sciensano processes additional data merely to
    identify the user. Pursuant to article 11 GDPR, Sciensano cannot be obliged to
    process such additional data to identify the user for the sole purpose of
    complying with the data subject rights under the GDPR. This means that in
    practice, users will not be able to exercise their data subject rights unless
    additional information is provided to Sciensano.
</p>
<p>
    Users have the right to lodge a complaint with the Belgian Supervisory
    Authority (https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be /
    https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be /
    https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be).
</p>
<h2>Amendments to this privacy statement</h2>
<p>
    Sciensano may amend this privacy statement from time to time in which case,
    Sciensano will inform the user of such change by means of a notification in
    the Contact Tracing App.
</p>
