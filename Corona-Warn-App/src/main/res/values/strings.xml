    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_tracing">Exposure Logging</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_tracing">Exposure logging is one of the three central features of the app. When you activate it, encounters with people\'s devices are logged. You don\'t have to do anything else.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_risk">Risk of Infection</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_risk">If you have had contact within the last 14 days with a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19, the app calculates your personal risk of infection. It does this by measuring duration and proximity of the exposure.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_risk_levels">The following risk status can be shown:</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_increased_risk">Higher Risk</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_low_risk">Low Risk</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_unknown_risk">Unknown Risk</string>
    <string name="main_overview_headline_test">Notifying Other Users</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_test">Another central feature is registering your test and retrieving the result. If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, you can notify others and break the chain of infection.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_headline_glossary">Definition of Terms:</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_glossary_tracing">Exposure Log</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_tracing">List of received and temporary random IDs saved temporarily in the operating system storage. This list is read when the exposures are checked. All random IDs are automatically deleted after 14 days.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_glossary_calculation">Exposure Check</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_calculation">Exposure log data is retrieved and synchronized with reported infections of other users. The exposure check is performed automatically about every two hours.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_glossary_contact">Exposures</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_contact">Encounters over a longer duration and close proximity to people diagnosed with COVID-19.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_glossary_notification">Exposure Notification</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_notification">If you have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 and who has shared his or her result in the Coronalert application, you will be notified through the exposure notification.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_glossary_keys">Random IDs</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_keys">Random IDs are combinations of digits and letters generated randomly. They are exchanged between devices in close proximity. Random IDs cannot be traced to a specific person and are automatically deleted after 14 days. Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 can opt to share their random IDs of up to the last 14 days with other app users.</string>
