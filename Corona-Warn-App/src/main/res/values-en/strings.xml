    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_tracing">Exposure Logging</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_tracing">Exposure logging is one of the three central features of the app. When you activate it, encounters with people\'s devices are logged. You don\'t have to do anything else.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_risk">Risk of Infection</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_risk">If you have had contact within the last 14 days with a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19, the app calculates your personal risk of infection. It does this by measuring duration and proximity of the exposure.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_risk_levels">The following risk status can be shown:</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_increased_risk">Higher Risk</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_low_risk">Low Risk</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_unknown_risk">Unknown Risk</string>
    <string name="main_overview_headline_test">Notifying Other Users</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_test">Another central feature is registering your test and retrieving the result. If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, you can notify others and break the chain of infection.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_headline_glossary">Definition of Terms:</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_glossary_tracing">Exposure Log</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_tracing">List of received and temporary random IDs saved temporarily in the operating system storage. This list is read when the exposures are checked. All random IDs are automatically deleted after 14 days.</string>
    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_glossary_calculation">Exposure Check</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_calculation">Exposure log data is retrieved and synchronized with reported infections of other users. The exposure check is performed automatically about every two hours.</string>

    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_contact">Encounters over a longer duration and close proximity to people diagnosed with COVID-19.</string>

    <string name="main_overview_subtitle_glossary_keys">Random IDs</string>
    <string name="main_overview_body_glossary_keys">Random IDs are combinations of digits and letters generated randomly. They are exchanged between devices in close proximity. Random IDs cannot be traced to a specific person and are automatically deleted after 14 days. Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 can opt to share their random IDs of up to the last 14 days with other app users.</string>

    <string name="onboarding_tracing_body">Exposure logging works by your device receiving, via Bluetooth, encrypted random IDs of other users and passing your own random ID to their devices. This feature can be deactivated at any time.</string>
    <string name="onboarding_tracing_body_emphasized">The encrypted random IDs only pass information about date, duration and proximity (using signal strength) to other people. Personal data such as name, address, location is never recorded. Individuals cannot be identified.</string>
    <string name="onboarding_tracing_headline_consent">Declaration of Consent</string>
    <string name="onboarding_tracing_body_consent">To find out whether you have been in contact with an infected person and whether there is a risk that you yourself have been infected, you need to enable the App’s exposure logging feature. By tapping on the “Enable” button, you agree to the enabling of the App’s exposure logging feature and the associated data processing.<xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g><xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g>In order to use the App’s exposure logging feature, you will have to enable the COVID-19 Exposure Logging functionality provided by Google on your smartphone and grant the Coronalert-App permission to use this.<xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g><xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g>When exposure logging is enabled, your smartphone continuously generates and transmits random IDs via Bluetooth, which other Android or Apple smartphones in your vicinity can receive if exposure logging is also enabled on them. Your smartphone, in turn, receives the random IDs of the other smartphones. Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones are recorded in the exposure log and stored there for 14 days.<xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g><xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g>To identify your risk of infection, the App loads a list – several times a day or on request – of the random IDs of all users who have told the App that they have been infected with the coronavirus. This list is then compared with the random IDs stored in the exposure log. If the App detects that you may have been in contact with an infected user, it will inform you of this and tell you that there is a risk that you are also infected. In this case, the App is also given access to other data stored in your smartphone’s exposure log (date, duration and Bluetooth signal strength of the contact).<xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g><xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g>The Bluetooth signal strength is used to derive the physical distance (the stronger the signal, the smaller the distance). The App then analyses this information in order to assess your likelihood of having been infected with the coronavirus and to give you recommendations for what to do next. This analysis is only performed locally on your smartphone. Apart from you, nobody (not even the RKI) will know whether you have been in contact with an infected person and what risk has been identified for you.<xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g><xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g>To withdraw your consent to the exposure logging feature, you can disable the feature using the toggle switch in the App or delete the App. If you decide to use the exposure logging feature again, you can toggle the feature back on or reinstall the App. If you disable the exposure logging feature, the App will no longer check whether you have been in contact with an infected user. If you also wish to stop your device sending and receiving random IDs, you will need to disable COVID-19 Exposure Logging in your smartphone settings. Please note that your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones which are stored in the exposure log will not be deleted in the App. You can only permanently delete the data stored in the exposure log in your smartphone settings.<xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g><xliff:g id="line_break">\n</xliff:g>The App’s privacy notice (including an explanation of the data processing carried out for the exposure logging feature) can be found in the menu under “Data Privacy Information”.</string>
